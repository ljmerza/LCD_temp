The goal of this project was to test out the temperature sensor and LCD screen for a larger long term project. It involves using the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor to display these values on a LCD. LEDs were also added as an extra representation of the temperature with 15 LEDs each representing a 2 degree Fahrenheit change in temperature from 60 degrees (green LEDs) to 90 degrees (red LEDs). The LCD screen's contrast will be controlled with a potentiometer.
